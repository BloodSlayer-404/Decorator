### Introduction:
This is an example of the structural design pattern called "Decorator" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example simulates how a player can hava new abilities or characteristics using some items or objects. For this case,  the [Human](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Decorator/blob/master/src/main/java/org/example/Human.java "Human") class can change some actions when it is wrapped in another class. Is that class is a [Horse](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Decorator/blob/master/src/main/java/org/example/HorseDecorator.java "Horse"), then the speed go up, and the description of the movement change. For the [Water Boots](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Decorator/blob/master/src/main/java/org/example/WaterBootsDecorator.java "Water Boots") the same things happen, bur in this case, the speed goes down.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Decorator/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Decorator/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
